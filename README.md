# OpenCodeList

The OpenCodeList Format (OpenCodeList) is a standardized [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format for representing generic code lists. 

The main features are:

+ Definition of generic code lists and code list collections using [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
+ Support for versioning
+ Support for multilingual strings
+ Support for multi-column keys
+ Support for multi-column foreign keys as reference to external code lists
+ OpenCodeList documents can be validated against the [OpenCodeList Document Schema](https://github.com/openpotato/opencodelist/blob/main/schemas/v0.3/schema.json)
+ Semantically largely compatible with [Code List Representation (genericode)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/genericode/v1.0/genericode-v1.0.html)
+ Open Source

## Documentation

The documentation website is part of this repository. We have implemented it using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). It is published under https://openpotato.github.io/opencodelist/.
