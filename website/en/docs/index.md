# Introduction

OpenCodeList is a standardised JSON format for the generic representation of code lists.

The main features are:

+ Definition of generic code lists and code list collections using [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
+ Support for versioning
+ Support for multilingual strings
+ Support for multi-column keys
+ Support for multi-column foreign keys as reference to external code lists
+ OpenCodeList documents can be validated against the [OpenCodeList Document Schema](https://github.com/openpotato/opencodelist/blob/main/schemas/v0.2/schema.json)
+ Semantically largely compatible with [Code List Representation (genericode)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/genericode/v1.0/genericode-v1.0.html)
+ Open Source

## Examples

The following OpenCodeList example documents are available:

+ [ISO 3166-2 Codes for Germany](https://github.com/openpotato/opencodelist/tree/main/samples/germany.federal-state-codes-2025-01-01.json)
+ [Capitals of the German federal states](https://github.com/openpotato/opencodelist/tree/main/samples/germany.federal-state-capitals-2025-01-01.json)

## Current Status

OpenCodeList is still very new and is being released here in its very first version. We would greatly appreciate any [feedback](community.md).
